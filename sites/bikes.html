      <h2>The dead prince</h2>
      <p>
        Gone but not forgotten. This was a bike I got from my brother and I used
        back when I was a bike messenger. All my love for bikes started with the
        prince. My lovely friend Laura drew me a picture of him for a tattoo I
        have.

      <h2>Ship of Ophelia</h2>
      <p>
        Ophelia is a retro racing bike made of steel. She is the bike I bought
        after the prince got diagnosed with a terminal crack in the frame. So a
        fair few of her parts are from the prince.

      <h2>Unamed Lady Macbeth</h2>
      <p>
        This red Univega I have yet to name but she is not any less loved. She
        went through a bit of a yassification when I got her which is why I'm
        very proud her current looks. I bought her to have a bike I could go
        tripping with so hopefully she will be fully ready for that soon.
