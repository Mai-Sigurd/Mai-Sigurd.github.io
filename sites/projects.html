      <h2>Research Project: Bike network expansion</h2>
      <p>
        For this research project my group and I looked into the bike network
        expansion made by Szell et al in
        <a href="https://github.com/mszell/bikenwgrowth" target="_blank"
          >this repo</a
        >. We added an extra variable, simulated and tested the outcomes in
        order to see how this bike network expansion would perfom in a
        developing city.
